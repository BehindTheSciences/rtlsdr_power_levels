# rtlsdr_power_levels
This script can be run with the pyrtlsdr library: https://github.com/roger-/pyrtlsdr 
You can connect two SDR-RTL dongles receiving two different RF signals and get their power level concurrently. We use the multi-threading Python function "Pool" to achieve this.
In order to configure your dongles, you can have a look at these guides: https://behindthesciences.com/electronics/how-to-set-up-raspberry-pi-3-to-use-rtl-sdr-usb-dongles-and-run-python-scripts/ and https://behindthesciences.com/coding/get-power-level-two-rf-signals
